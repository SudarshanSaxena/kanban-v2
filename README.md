# Kanban Board by Sudarshan Saxena

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.


## Checklist covered
Use Dummy API: Fetch and update todos using DummyJSON Todos API. ❌
Instead of using a dummy api, I created my own database and APIs using Supabase ✅
I did this as to enhance my web portfolio 🚀
The current version is deployed on AWS cloudfront and is linked to my personal domain 
# `https://kanban.sudosuper.com`

## Functional implementation
Fetch and display todos from the API. ✅

Create a new todo. ✅

Update a todo (edit title, description, etc.). ✅

Change the status of a todo (move between lanes). ✅

Delete a todo. ✅

## Additional Features
Create a new Board 🚀
Create new columns inside the board 🚀


## UI requirements - Objective (looks good to me 😜)
Use a Kanban-style board with vertical lanes for different statuses (e.g.,"Pending", "In Progress", "Completed"). ✅
Allow users to drag and drop todos between lanes to update their status. ✅
Simple but clean UI/UX (minimal styling required, but it should be visually
understandable). ✅


# Decisions
The overall architecture is very simple
